## Overview

I am a self-taught senior software engineer with over 15 years of experience delivering high-performance, production-grade systems across embedded platforms, backend architectures, and cross-platform applications. My career includes firmware development, scalable API design, CI/CD automation, DevOps, and mobile application delivery. I have operated in industries such as smart cities, automotive diagnostics, industrial manufacturing, fintech, and SaaS. I prioritize pragmatic architecture, clean code, cross-functional collaboration, and continuous delivery.
