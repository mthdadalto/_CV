* Acted as the main DevOps and infrastructure engineer within the team, responsible for setting up and maintaining CI/CD workflows tailored to embedded Linux systems. * Designed automation flows using Bash and Python, integrating tools like SonarQube and pytest, and ensuring each build went through version tagging, static analysis, and automated regression testing. These pipelines significantly improved consistency and reduced the manual effort required for release preparation.

* Worked extensively with modern C++ (C++11/17) to develop modules for ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) using OpenCV. Focused on performance, memory efficiency, and integration with real-time camera input pipelines. This included direct coordination with QA to validate algorithms in realistic edge-device environments.

* Led the prototyping and technical design of a new container-based deployment system, migrating from a monolithic Yocto stack to lightweight modular Linux environments (Debian Slim, Ubuntu Core). Participated in strategic architectural decisions, evaluating tradeoffs between legacy compatibility and long-term maintainability.

* Documented system architecture, CI workflows, onboarding steps, and debugging tools to support other engineers and future scaling of the team. Regularly collaborated with QA, firmware, and embedded teams to diagnose system behavior, hardware failures, and cross-layer issues across software and physical deployments.

* Contributed to sprint planning, team retrospectives, and internal code reviews. Helped guide process improvement discussions and technical standards, ensuring delivery pipelines and software modules were aligned with the team’s goals and long-term vision.

### Backend Software Engineer, Ebit Labs (Remote)
June 2022 to October 2023

* Focused on building and scaling backend systems to support a high-throughput analytics platform for NFTs and crypto markets. Designed microservices using Deno (TypeScript), PostgreSQL, and Redis to process and aggregate large volumes of blockchain data. Paid particular attention to query optimization and data transformation, refactoring critical components to reduce processing time from over 30 minutes to under one second.

* Created and maintained CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions and ArgoCD, automating container-based deployments across staging and production Kubernetes clusters. Defined validation steps, tagging strategies, and health checks to ensure every release was tested, traceable, and production-ready.

* Designed and implemented currency conversion and token comparison logic, integrating external APIs (e.g., Kraken) to provide real-time valuations. Focused on reliability and fault-tolerance, incorporating schema validation and monitoring with Grafana to track data pipeline behavior and latency.

* Worked closely with product and frontend engineers to design clean REST interfaces and schema contracts. Participated in sprint planning, code reviews, architecture discussions, and internal retrospectives. Helped drive alignment between engineering and business by translating complex technical concepts into actionable delivery items.

* Documented key systems and workflows for team reference, onboarding, and long-term maintainability. Supported early feature validation and QA feedback loops to ensure analytics were accurate, secure, and scalable from the start.

### Senior Software Engineer, Snap-on and TreadReader
March 2018 to June 2022

* Designed and implemented embedded firmware in C for diagnostic equipment, including mechanical control, safety logic, and sensor data acquisition using UART, I2C, SPI, GPIO, and TCP/UDP communication protocols.

* Built a full-featured WPF desktop application that acted as the central system hub. It provided configuration management, diagnostics, firmware update workflows, system calibration, and hardware communication over serial and network interfaces.

* Ported and modularized MATLAB/C++ control algorithms into high-performance, reusable .NET Standard DLLs. These libraries handled sensor interpretation, calibration logic, flow processing, and were used across multiple platforms.

* Developed and published two Xamarin mobile applications for Android and iOS to visualize real-time scan data, control calibration workflows, and provide on-site diagnostics in mobile contexts.

* Built two additional cross-platform mobile applications using Xamarin and shared .NET components to support remote diagnostics and guided hardware setup.

* Engineered a GPU-accelerated cloudpoint analysis pipeline using OpenCV and 3D rendering techniques to generate real-time profiling of tire surfaces and highlight anomalies.

* Delivered internal packaging and installer automation using Inno Setup and custom scripting, allowing fast and repeatable deployment for both embedded and desktop systems.

* Served as the technical contact and integrator for external partners, including project stakeholders from companies like Continental, aligning business needs with technical feasibility.

* Acted as the go-to developer across multiple product lines, leading key technical decisions, selecting technology stacks, and structuring long-term architectural patterns.

* Conducted exploratory R&D and prototyping across several initiatives, producing feasibility demos and proof-of-concept solutions for new product ideas.

* Maintained frequent collaboration with international teams (Europe, Asia, North America), supporting joint development phases, cross-validation, and integration strategies.

* Regularly mentored a junior engineer, providing code reviews, architectural guidance, and support in adopting best practices in C#, .NET, and firmware development.

### Software Engineer, Rational Labelling

September 2017 to March 2018

* Worked on industrial automation systems, building both embedded and desktop software to control and monitor label printing machines used in UK-scale production environments. Developed Python-based drivers to interface with TCP and BLE communication modules on Raspberry Pi, enabling real-time machine feedback, diagnostics, and remote control capabilities.

* Designed and implemented a WPF desktop application that served as the centralized configuration and monitoring hub for the entire production line. This system allowed real-time visualization, line control, and remote configuration, significantly improving on-site operability and visibility.

* Built additional tools for field and factory operations, including a desktop label design application and a Java-based Android app used to calibrate and align smart cameras for automated scanning and detection during the label printing process.

* Maintained and extended internal platforms such as a PHP-based admin interface and an e-commerce backend for managing hardware deliveries, machine registration, and technician access.

* Worked closely with factory operators and QA staff to validate the system on the production floor. Supported system debugging, hardware integration, and rollout of live monitoring features. Frequently adapted software components to reflect evolving hardware requirements and on-site operational feedback.
